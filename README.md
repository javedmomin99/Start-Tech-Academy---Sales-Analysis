# Start-Tech-Academy---Sales-Analysis
Check out my new project! I used Power BI to build a Sales Analysis Dashboard that turns a bunch of numbers into a clear, visual story. It's all about making data easy to understand so we can find out what's really happening with sales.

A few things this dashboard shows:

Which products are selling the most? (Spoiler: Technology is a big winner!)

Where are we making the most profit? (The West region is leading the way.)

How do sales in different regions compare? (You can see a side-by-side view for a quick comparison.)

This project was a great way to put my data visualization and analysis skills to the test. Hope you like it!
